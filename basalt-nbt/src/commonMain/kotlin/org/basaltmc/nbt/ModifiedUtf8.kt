/**
 * NBT tag names and string payloads are encoded with Java's "modified UTF-8"
 * (`java.io.DataOutput.writeUTF` / `DataInput.readUTF`), not plain UTF-8: the null character
 * is encoded as two bytes instead of one, and supplementary characters are encoded as two
 * separate 3-byte sequences (one per UTF-16 surrogate half) instead of one 4-byte sequence.
 * Reading real Mojang-written NBT (player data, chunks, structures) with plain UTF-8 would
 * silently corrupt any string containing such characters, so this is implemented explicitly
 * rather than reusing `String.encodeToByteArray()`.
