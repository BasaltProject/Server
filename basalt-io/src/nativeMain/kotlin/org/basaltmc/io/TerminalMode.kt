 * terminal buffers a whole line and echoes what it does not understand, so an arrow key prints
 * `^[[A` instead of reaching the program: history editing needs this.
 *
 * Returns whether the mode changed. `false` means stdin is not a terminal, which is not a failure:
 * the caller falls back to plain line reading, all those cases support anyway.
