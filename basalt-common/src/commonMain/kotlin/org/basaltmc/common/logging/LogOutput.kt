 * Where log lines actually go. The console always gets them; anything else (a log file, a plugin

 *
 * Sinks are a callback rather than a direct file write because `basalt-common` has no dependencies
 * by design, so it cannot reach the filesystem itself. The file sink lives in `basalt-io`, which
 * can, and installs itself here at startup.
 *
 * Sinks receive the plain line, never the coloured one: colour is a terminal affordance, and
 * escape codes written into a log file are noise that every later reader has to strip.
